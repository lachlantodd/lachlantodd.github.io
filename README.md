Submission for the final project of Harvard's CS50x Introduction to Computer Science through edX.

I created a website, ausgpa.com, to assist myself and other students in Australia with calculating their GPA per semester.
Normally, each semester I would perform these calculations on a piece of paper, throwing it away after the semester. With this tool, my calculations are much quicker, more intuitive and efficient.

The website has been created purely as a front-end implementation, with javascript at its core to enable maximum interactability, reactiveness and a positive user experience. From start to finish, this project took just under a week to complete as I was really enjoying the process and maintained motivation and productivity.
